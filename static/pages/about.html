      Welcome to ZephyrPlus! ZephyrPlus is an intuitive online interface to MIT's command line chat system, Zephyr. ZephyrPlus lets you chat from anywhere and will save the chats you miss when you're offline. ZephyrPlus is beautiful, sleek, and simple enough for anyone to simply login and just start chatting.

Zephyr is a historical part of MITâ€™s culture, yet very few individuals use it. We believe the biggest cause of this is the high barrier of entry for zephyr. Zephyr is centered around use of the command line, and those not familiar with it have a difficult time getting started. In fact, even with command line experience, Zephyr is only easily accessible from Linux. ZephyrPlus provides access to anyone from any OS.

ZephyrPlus was developed for Communicating with Web-based media, 21W.785 under the instruction of Ed Barrett.

Happy chatting!
